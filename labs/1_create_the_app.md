# Lab 1: Create the app
 
In this lab, we'll set up the Github repository, make sure your team can pull, merge and push code. We'll work with a newly created React app to do all that.
 
## Set up the Github repository
- One team member should create the repository on Github. They should clone the repo locally, add a README.md file, and push the changes.
- Other team members will then clone the repository locally, make a change to the README.md file, and push their changes.
- Make sure everyone can pull, merge and push code without issues.

You're now ready to begin building the app!

## Scaffold the React project
- One team member should use vite to create the project. Make sure to specify that we'll be using TypeScript.
- Run and test the app locally.

Before finishing, make sure all team members have the latest code from the repository and can run the app locally.
