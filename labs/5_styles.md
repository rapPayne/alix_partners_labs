# Lab 5: Styles

Finally we get to add some styles and layout to our app! 

Go through each of your components and add CSS styles to make your app look good. You do not have to make it look exactly like the mockups, but make them look nice and polished. Please do not use any CSS frameworks like Bootstrap or Tailwind. Write your own CSS.

Use a consistent color scheme and typography throughout the app. We want a cohesive look and feel.

As a reminder, here are the page-level components you have so far and a screen shot of each.

## Landing

## Film Details

## Pick Seats
Please remember for this one, we are not building the seat map yet, just style the page as it is now.

## Others
Also style your nav bar and any other components you have created that are not shown in the mockups.
